Cloak V4
==============
This is a fork of https://github.com/TeamAcedia/CloakV4 just to send suggested fixes back to the developers.
This fork will not be updated on an ongoing basis, so if you want to download CloakV4, please use the /TeamAcedia repository instead of this one.

A minetest cheat client based off of Luanti 5.12.0.

It was recently updated to 5.12.0 and many new features were added, if you want to use the old 5.9.1 version, go to the legacy branch.

This client's name is based off of TeamAcedia's previous clients, CloakV3, CloakV2, and Cloak

### Important info:
This client includes almost all CSM api additions from dragonfire, although it hasn't been documented (yet). It also includes many built-in client side mods and a new minimalistic design for the cheat menu. If any bug or error is found, please open an issue about it. We'd like to hear your opinion.
